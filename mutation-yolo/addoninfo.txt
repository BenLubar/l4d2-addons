	addonDescription "You only live once. At least, until someone finds a defibrillator.

This realism mutation couples the excitement of 'two zombies at the same time' with the fun that is 'you have five health'.

Survive the zombie apocalypse. Or don't. You're inches away from dying with no health or pain pills in sight.

Oh, and by the way, that 'two zombies at the same time' thing? That's going to happen constantly. Forever. You kill a special infected and another one pops up behind you and strangles Ellis.

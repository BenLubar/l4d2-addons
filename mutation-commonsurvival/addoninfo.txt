	addonDescription "Do you love shooting zombies but hate all the strategy involved?

'Do I shoot the boomer over there or should I aim my shotgun a bit to the left and shoot the hunter?'

No longer! With Common Survival, all you have to do is aim at a zombie's head and click! It's that simple!

Oh, and by the way, once you've killed those first 30 zombies, the next group is 45. Then 60. Then 75. Eventually, you're fighting the floor - and the floor is made of zombies!"
